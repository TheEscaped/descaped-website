Saddest moments of life are when you have to say goodbye to people you want to see tomorrow.

One thing I have learned and admired is that life keeps on changing. With each moment you create a new memory.
Sitting in the plane all alone was hard. Very hard!

Not too long before I boarded the plane I had hugged and said farewell to my closest group of friends. It was difficult to see them hold in their sadness to show me tranquility that everything will be all right. Everyone smiled but it was not the same glow that I would have seen at a dinner table, a movie theatre, hiking, or sitting by a fountain. We all knew tomorrow would be hard but no one wanted to talk. Each hug was couple seconds longer than usual, so we could hold on a moment longer. As I prepared to go through the security line at the airport I kept looking back at my friends waving their hands. The Chapter had just ended.

The plane ride was same as usual. It was delayed for a couple of hours. I waited eagerly to get out of the airport to be picked up and go home.

My mother had prepared one of my favorite dishes: Paranthas, carb rich Indian roti stuffed with cauliflower and spices. Welcoming was gormandizing.

It feels amazing to be home like a child getting back to his toys after returning after a long day of school. House smell was pungent as most Indian houses tend to be. As delicious as the home cooked food can be, however, it leaves a peculiar smell that follows you like a shadow.

Nevertheless, I was home and getting ready to be spoiled few more times before my adventure.
Let’s just say everyday was a feast. I was eating like there was no tomorrow. I fed on Kulchas, tandoori roti stuffed with spices and potato, which were snuck back from India along with some Halva (sweet Indian dessert that no diabetic should eat). Ah, the memories things can bring back are vast and warmly.

There are days we fed on simple dishes that I had grown up to. Then couple of times we had gone out to eat fine dining with family and friends; it was non-stop gorging!

I am ashamed to even look at the weight machine. Why would you? When a mother/grandmother cooks with her own hand with love you eat it with delight. In this trip I will eat from different places, I will eat different things, but no matter how expensive it might be or how exotic it might be it is the simple home cooked meal that creates everlasting memory.
Oh it’s good to be pampered once in a while!!!

Time is coming close to end at home. I am running here and there trying to pick up things; and most importantly getting ready for my flight. I am anxious but more excited. I am trying to spend as much time as I can with my family. Everyday my mother wakes me up at 6:30 in the morning so we can go on our regular hour and a half long walks gossiping and chatting about different things. We see things differently but there is much similarity that might not be apparent to either of us. These walks are enchanting. The cool Chicago weather and greenery layering the neighborhood along with amazing houses that outdo themselves one after another made every walk refreshing. Once in a while we would get lucky to see marvels of Frank lloyd wright, the famous architect who famously established the organic architecture.

While in the evening, once in a while, the three of us (father, mother, and me) would enjoy a glass of fine wine making fun of each other while grandma enjoys a glass of juice recalling her travelling days.

It’s a fun family!

Then there are friends with whom I had gotten to enjoy few last laughs with; who had taken me in when I had first stepped foot on this land leaving my old country, India. Not to mention I had an amazing date; with my mom accompanied by my friend and his mom; talking about travelling and philosophy.

Family is such an amazing thing that no matter how bad things can get they will be by your side; I know they are not happy and I know that this trip of mine is going to cost them worries. However, they still continue to do things so I could have the best time whatever I choose to do.

We get opportunities in life to make something, to do something but not matter how apparent those opportunities might be we are afraid and restrict ourselves with our own boundaries. My pursuit is simple but challenging; to pursue something that cannot be memorized from books but to enjoy and immerse myself with what the world has to offer: the people, the history, the natural beauty, the food, and hopefully friendships.

I wait fervidly. There is shakiness with excitement. Later today I am to board on my flight on Polish airlines. I still have to finish packing and I still have to say goodbyes. Time has started to move very fast and I am afraid to blink.
