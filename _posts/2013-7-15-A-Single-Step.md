summary: Life is a journey and we are story tellers. How can we tell a unique story unless we step outside the conventional way of living.

“Journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step”- Lao Tzu

The iPhone starts ringing, and awareness comes to life. Slowly and creepily! With half open eyes I start paying attention to my usual surrounding. Nothing is different. Two friends on the couch sleeping motionless, and one in the shower whose getting ready for his daily routine. Shoes lay at the same spot but somehow everyday a new pair joins the family. Clothes are left half in the laundry basket and half on the floor.

The air as brisk as it was, there was something strange up in the air. The quietness was exquisite; every corner of the apartment was coming into life with its silent sound. The fan is rattling louder, and ants are dancing in the kitchen.
It was incredible, this small studio apartment was as still as the moon shinning in the lightless night but as loud as a maestro at an amphitheater enthralling the crowd. 

As I awake looking at the window watching, a grin went through my face. It’s a familiar feeling; the same feeling when a relationship ends. There is sadness but still happiness. The old life was over, and a new one was taking its shape. I did not have to wake up following the same routine I had done for the last three years.  I am FREE! 

Did I make the right decision? Giving up comfort and time with family and friends? Not everyone at my age chooses to end a good job with a good salary to be unemployed, to spend all of their savings to travel, and to give up all material things.  Maybe I was taken by Siddhartha, a novel by Herman Hesse. 

Why “life” has to be so structured? It begins with High School, then we go to a University, then we need to find a job, so that we can get into a good graduate school to find a good job then 9-5 daily routine begins until retirement. Where in that part do we actually get to live? 

I decided to take the risk; to venture my energy and to enjoy a free education, a free life lesson and to live. Maybe I am a fool. I will be walking towards the abyss with a backpacking bag, a camera in my hand, a new set of glasses and hopefully the charm to get me out of trouble. 
So next stop Budapest, Hungary! köszönöm
